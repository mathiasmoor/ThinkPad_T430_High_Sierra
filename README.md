<h1>Step by Step - GUIDE</h1>

<b>1. step - Create Bootable USB with High Sierra installator.</b> I think, the best choice for  creating USB installator is Olarila image from this links: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIeW2LCRZPSNq3_RiTvefAGIT_2fGfaW/view?usp=sharing
or if you have existing MAC OS system, you can create USB with original AppStore version of High Sierra with latest version of Clover EFI.

<b>2. step - Installation MAC OS</b> - Boot installation from created USB stick, and format your SSD / HDD  as MAC OS Extended (Journaled)- [HSF] with scheme GUID Partition Map.
